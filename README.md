# ðŸšš Optimizing a Delivery System

Final project for my Data Structures and Algorithms course. 

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of multiple fundamental data structures and algorithms to simulate and optimize a delivery system. The system focuses on route planning, order management, and performance benchmarking across several modules.

Designed with modularity and real-world logistics in mind, the project emphasizes how algorithmic problem-solving can enhance delivery efficiency and decision-making.

## ðŸ§  Core Concepts

 **Arrays & Lists:** Store, display, and search orders using arrays, singly & doubly linked lists, and skip lists.
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Prioritize deliveries using Selection, Bubble, Merge, and Quick Sort, with runtime analysis.
- **Trees & Searching:** Organize and search orders using Binary Search Trees (BST) and AVL Trees, with balanced insertions and traversals.
- **Graph Traversals:** Represent a delivery map using graphs with Adjacency Lists & Matrices. Route finding via:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm for shortest paths
